\usage{
calc_next(
  y,
  n,
  p0,
  direction = "greater",
  delta = NULL,
  prior = c(0.5, 0.5),
  S = 5000,
  interval = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{number of events observed so far. Vector of length two c(y0, y1)
for the two-sample case; integer y for the one-sample case.}

\item{n}{sample size observed so far. Vector of length two c(n0, n1)
for the two-sample case; integer n for the one-sample case.}

\item{p0}{the target value to compare to in the one-sample case. Set to NULL
for the two-sample case.}

\item{direction}{"greater" (default) if interest is in P(p1 > p0) in the
two-sample case or P(p > p0) in the one-sample case; "less"
if interest is in P(p1 < p0) for the two-sample case or P(p < p0) for the
one-sample case.}

\item{delta}{clinically meaningful difference between groups.
Typically 0 for the two-sample case. NULL for one-sample case (default).}

\item{prior}{vector of length two containing hyperparameters of the prior
beta distribution. c(0.5, 0.5) is default, for the Beta(0.5, 0.5)
distribution.}

\item{S}{number of samples, default is 5000}

\item{interval}{a value between 0 and 1 indicating the width of the desired
interval, default is 0.95}
}
\value{
Returns a tibble with the empiric mean and
highest posterior density interval
}
\description{
This function is meant to be used in the context of a
clinical trial with a binary endpoint. For the two-sample case, the total
number of events in the standard-of-care arm is y0 and the total number of
events in the experimental arm is y1. The function samples from the posterior
beta distribution based on the data and the prior beta hyperparameters, and
returns the empiric mean and highest posterior density interval for the next
patient. The empiric mean represents the probability of the binary outcome
occurring in the next patient.
The one-sample case is also available, in which a target p0
must be specified..
