\usage{

  pp_threshold,

}
\arguments{
\item{p_null}{vector of length two containing the probability of event in
the standard of care and experimental arm c(p0, p1) for the two-sample case
for the null scenario;
integer of event probability for one-sample case}

\item{p_alt}{vector of length two containing the probability of event in
the standard of care and experimental arm c(p0, p1) for the two-sample case
for the alternative scenario;
integer of event probability for one-sample case}

\item{n}{matrix containing the total number of patients accrued so far at
each interim look in the standard of care (column 1) and experimental
(column 2) arms for two-sample case; vector of sample size accrued so far
at each interim look for one-sample case. The last value should be equal to
the total sample size at the end of the trial.
If only a single look will be done
at the end of the trial, this can be a vector specifying the total sample
size c(N0, N1) for the two-sample case or an integer specifying the total
sample size N for the one-sample case}

\item{N}{the total planned sample size at the end of the trial, c(N0, N1)
for two-sample case; integer of total planned sample size at end of trial N
for one-sample case}

\item{pp_threshold}{the posterior probability threshold of interest}

\item{ppp_threshold}{the posterior predictive probability threshold of
interest for futility monitoring}

\item{direction}{"greater" (default) if interest is in p(p1 > p0) and "less"
if interest is in p(p1 < p0) for two-sample case. For one-sample case,
"greater" if interest is in p(p > p0) and "less" if interest is in p(p < p0).}

\item{delta}{clinically meaningful difference between groups.
Typically 0 for the two-sample case. NULL for the one-sample case (default).}

\item{monitoring}{the type of interim monitoring to be perfomed. One of
"futility" or "efficacy". Default is "futility".}

\item{prior}{hyperparameters of prior beta distribution.
Beta(0.5, 0.5) is default}

\item{S}{number of samples drawn from the posterior. Default is 5000}

\item{nsim}{Number of simulated trial datasets.}
}
\value{
A list containing a
\enumerate{
\item a tibble 'res_summary' containing the posterior probability threshold
(pp_threshold), the predictive probability threshold (ppp_threshold),
the mean sample size under the null (mean_n0_null and mean_n1_null
for two-sample case; mean_n1_null for one-sample case), the proportion of
positive trials under the null (prop_pos_null), the proportion of trials
stopped early under the null (prop_stopped_null), the mean sample
size under the alternative (mean_n0_alt and mean_n1_alt
for two-sample case; mean_n1_alt for one-sample case), the proportion of
positive trials under the alternative (prop_pos_alt), the proportion of
trials stopped early under the alternative (prop_stopped_alt)
\item 'call_list' containing the original function call
\item 'calibrate_thresholds_inputs' a list containing the inputs to the
original function call
}

The proportion of positive trials will be a measure of the type I error
for a null setting, and a measure of the power in the alternative setting.
}
\description{
This function is meant to be used in the context of a
clinical trial with a binary endpoint. For every combination of the provided
posterior thresholds and predictive thresholds, the function simulates many
trials and then calculates the average number of times a trial was positive.
In the null case, this is the type I error for the given thresholds.
In the alternative case, this is the power for the given thresholds.
